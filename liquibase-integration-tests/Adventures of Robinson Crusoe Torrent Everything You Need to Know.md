- It is a faithful adaptation of the book, capturing the spirit and themes of Defoe's masterpiece. It explores the topics of survival, faith, friendship, and human nature in a realistic and engaging way.
- It is a rare example of a film directed by Luis BuÃ±uel, one of the most influential and innovative filmmakers of all time. BuÃ±uel is known for his surreal and provocative films, such as Un Chien Andalou (1929), The Exterminating Angel (1962), and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie (1972). However, this film shows his ability to craft a more conventional and accessible story, without losing his artistic vision and style.

He portrays Crusoe's emotions, thoughts, and struggles with subtlety and charisma. He also speaks in Spanish for some parts of the film, as BuÃ±uel wanted to give it a more authentic feel.
- It has stunning cinematography and scenery, shot on location in Mexico. The film uses natural light and colors to create a vivid and immersive atmosphere. The island looks beautiful and wild, contrasting with Crusoe's loneliness and isolation.
- It has a memorable score by Anthony Collins, which adds to the mood and drama of the film. The music ranges from solemn and melancholic to lively and adventurous, reflecting Crusoe's journey and character development.

These are just some of the reasons why you should watch The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1954). It is a classic film that deserves more recognition and appreciation.
