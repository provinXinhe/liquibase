If you want to know more about the Mechromancer DLC, here are some tips and tricks to make the most of this character and her skills:

- The Mechromancer has three skill trees: Best Friends Forever, Little Big Trouble, and Ordered Chaos. Each one offers a different play style and benefits for you and Deathtrap.
- Best Friends Forever focuses on improving your survivability and teamwork with Deathtrap. You can gain health regeneration, shield restoration, damage reduction, and more. Some of the best skills in this tree are Upshot Robot, which increases Deathtrap's duration and melee damage with every kill, and Sharing is Caring, which grants Deathtrap a copy of your shield.
- Little Big Trouble focuses on enhancing your elemental damage and status effects, especially shock and fire. You can gain increased chances of applying burn, electrocute, corrode, and slag effects, as well as bonus damage for those effects. Some of the best skills in this tree are Electrical Burn, which makes your electrocute effects cause additional fire damage, and Wires Don't Talk, which increases all your shock and electrocute damage.
- Ordered Chaos focuses on boosting your damage output at the cost of accuracy and stability. You can gain stacks of Anarchy by killing enemies or emptying your magazine, which increase your damage but decrease your accuracy. You can also gain other bonuses or penalties depending on your Anarchy stacks. Some of the best skills in this tree are Blood Soaked Shields, which restores your shield fully with every kill but drains some of your health, and Discord, which improves your accuracy, fire rate, and health regeneration when you reload prematurely but consumes your Anarchy stacks.

Depending on your preference, you can choose one skill tree or mix and match skills from different trees to create your own build. Experiment with different combinations and see what works best for you.
