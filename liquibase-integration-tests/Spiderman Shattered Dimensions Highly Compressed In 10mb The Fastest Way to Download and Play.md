Spiderman Shattered Dimensions is a game that was released in 2010 by Activision and developed by Beenox and Griptonite Games. It is based on the Marvel comics and features four different Spidermen from different timelines and realities. They are:
 
- The Amazing Spiderman, who is the classic version of Spiderman that we all know and love. He has the standard abilities of web-shooting, wall-crawling, and spider-sense. He also has a witty and humorous personality.
- The Noir Spiderman, who is a darker and grittier version of Spiderman from the 1930s. He relies on stealth and melee combat to take down his enemies. He also has a noir-style narration and a somber mood.
- The 2099 Spiderman, who is a futuristic version of Spiderman from the year 2099. He has enhanced abilities such as gliding, sonic screams, and accelerated vision. He also has a cyberpunk aesthetic and a rebellious attitude.
- The Ultimate Spiderman, who is a younger version of Spiderman from an alternate universe. He wears a black symbiote suit that gives him extra strength, speed, and durability. He also has a more aggressive and impulsive personality.

The game's plot revolves around a mysterious artifact called the Tablet of Order and Chaos, which is shattered by an accident involving Spiderman and Mysterio. The fragments of the tablet are scattered across four dimensions, causing chaos and instability in each one. To restore order and balance, Madame Web recruits the four Spidermen and guides them to collect the fragments and stop the villains who are using them for their own purposes.
 
The game's gameplay consists of switching between the four Spidermen and exploring their respective worlds. Each world has its own style, theme, and enemies. The game also features boss battles against some of the most famous Spiderman villains, such as Kraven, Vulture, Electro, Carnage, Deadpool, and more. The game also has collectibles, challenges, and hidden spiders to find and unlock new costumes, upgrades, and achievements.
