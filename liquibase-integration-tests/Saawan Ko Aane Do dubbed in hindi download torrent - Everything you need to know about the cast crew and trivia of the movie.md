Ten has a strong fascination with fire and often uses his ability to breath flames as a weapon or a prank. However, his mother is a dedicated fire fighter who travels across the galaxy to put out infernos and save lives. She loves her job so much that she rarely stays on her home planet, which is why Ten lives on Earth with his cousin Lum. Whenever his mother visits Earth, Ten tries to restrain his pyromaniac tendencies so that he won't anger her or cause trouble. To keep an eye on Ten, his mother has given Ataru, Lum's human fiancÃ©, a special fire bell that can summon her instantly whenever he sees a fire. Ataru enjoys teasing Ten and provoking him to breath fire, and then ringing the bell at the last moment to get him in trouble.
  
Ten's mother is very proud of her son and often praises him for his bravery and intelligence. She also spoils him with gifts and treats whenever she sees him. However, she is also very strict and does not tolerate any mischief or disobedience from him. She often scolds him for his fire-breathing antics and warns him of the dangers of fire. She also disapproves of his crush on Sakura, the school nurse and a powerful exorcist, who is much older than him.

Ten is very loyal to his cousin Lum and often helps her in her schemes to win Ataru's love. He also defends her from other aliens who try to harm her or take her away from Ataru. He considers Ataru to be his rival and often fights with him over trivial matters. He also resents him for being engaged to Lum and for flirting with other girls. However, he also respects him for his courage and cunning, and sometimes teams up with him against a common enemy.
  
Ten is very curious about Earth and its culture and often explores the city with his flying scooter. He likes to make friends with other children and animals, but he also likes to prank them with his fire-breathing. He is afraid of water and cold weather, which can weaken his fire power. He also hates spicy food, which makes him sneeze fire uncontrollably. He loves sweets, especially chocolate, which can boost his fire power.
  
One day, Ten's mother receives a call from the Galactic Fire Brigade, asking her to join a mission to extinguish a massive fire on a distant planet. She decides to take Ten with her, thinking that it would be a good opportunity for him to learn more about her job and the importance of fire safety. She also hopes that it would curb his pyromaniac habits. She tells Lum and Ataru about her plan and asks them to pack Ten's belongings.
