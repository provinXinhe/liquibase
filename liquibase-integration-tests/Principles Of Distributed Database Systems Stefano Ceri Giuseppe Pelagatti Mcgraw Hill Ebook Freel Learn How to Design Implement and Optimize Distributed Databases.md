# Principles Of Distributed Database Systems: A Classic Textbook by Stefano Ceri and Giuseppe Pelagatti
 
Distributed database systems are becoming more and more important in the era of big data and cloud computing. They allow data to be stored and accessed across multiple nodes in a network, while ensuring consistency, availability, and scalability. However, designing and implementing distributed database systems is not a trivial task. It requires a solid understanding of the principles and techniques that underlie this field.

One of the most influential and comprehensive textbooks on distributed database systems is *Principles Of Distributed Database Systems* by Stefano Ceri and Giuseppe Pelagatti. First published in 1984 by McGraw-Hill, this book covers both the theoretical and practical aspects of distributed database systems, from the fundamentals of data distribution and replication, to the advanced topics of concurrency control, query processing, and recovery. The book also includes numerous examples and exercises to help readers apply the concepts to real-world scenarios.
 
The book has been widely adopted by universities and professionals around the world, and has been translated into several languages. It has also been updated and revised several times to reflect the latest developments and trends in the field. The latest edition, published in 2011 by Springer, features new chapters on peer-to-peer systems, web services, data integration, and distributed stream processing.

One of the benefits of distributed database systems is that they can handle large amounts of data that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to store and process on a single machine. Distributed database systems can also improve the performance and availability of data access by distributing the workload and providing redundancy. However, distributed database systems also pose some challenges and trade-offs that need to be carefully considered and addressed. For example, how to ensure data consistency and integrity across multiple nodes, how to cope with network failures and partitions, how to optimize query execution and data transfer, and how to secure data from unauthorized access and attacks.
 
*Principles Of Distributed Database Systems* by Stefano Ceri and Giuseppe Pelagatti provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to these issues and solutions. The book covers both the theoretical foundations and the practical applications of distributed database systems, with a balanced and rigorous approach. The book is suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners who want to learn more about this fascinating and important field.
