In *Chinese Zodiac*, Chan plays Asian Hawk, a treasure hunter who leads a team of mercenaries to recover the bronze heads of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. These artifacts were looted from the Old Summer Palace in Beijing by foreign invaders in the 19th century. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and enemies, as well as allies such as a Chinese student (Xingtong Yao) and a Parisian lady (Laura Weissbecker).
 
The film showcases Chan's impressive stunts and fight scenes, as well as his comedic timing and charisma. Some of the highlights include a chase sequence involving a rollerblade suit, a fight on a rotating sofa, and a skydiving finale. The film also explores themes such as cultural heritage, patriotism, and morality.
 
*Chinese Zodiac* was a hit in China and other Asian markets, but it received mixed reviews from critics and audiences in the West. Some praised it as a fun and entertaining action comedy, while others criticized it as being outdated, clichÃ©d, and lacking in plot and character development. The film also sparked some controversy for its portrayal of foreign characters and its political messages.
