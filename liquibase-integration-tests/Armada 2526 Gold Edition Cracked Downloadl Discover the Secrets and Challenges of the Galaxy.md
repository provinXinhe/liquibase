# How to Conquer the Galaxy with Armada 2526 Gold Edition
 
Armada 2526 Gold Edition is a 4X strategy game that lets you lead one of 18 different alien races to become a mighty pan-galactic empire. You will have to manage your colonies, deploy your fleets, conduct research, and engage in diplomacy and warfare with other factions. In this article, we will give you some tips and tricks on how to play Armada 2526 Gold Edition and achieve your galactic domination goals.
 
## Choose Your Race Wisely
 
Each of the 18 alien races in Armada 2526 Gold Edition has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique abilities and traits. Some races are better at research, some are better at trade, some are better at diplomacy, and some are better at combat. You should choose a race that suits your preferred playstyle and strategy. For example, if you want to focus on expansion and colonization, you might want to pick the Terrans or the Kariens, who have bonuses to population growth and planet suitability. If you want to focus on research and technology, you might want to pick the Arachnids or the Cyborgs, who have bonuses to research speed and efficiency. If you want to focus on trade and espionage, you might want to pick the Zantors or the Syliths, who have bonuses to trade income and spy effectiveness.

## Explore and Expand
 
The galaxy map in Armada 2526 Gold Edition is randomly generated each time you start a new game, so you never know what surprises await you in each star system. You should explore as much as possible to find new planets to colonize, new resources to exploit, new alien races to encounter, and new anomalies to investigate. You can use scout ships or probes to explore faster and cheaper than your main fleets. You should also expand your empire by colonizing new planets as soon as possible. The more planets you have, the more resources, population, and income you will generate. However, be careful not to overextend yourself too much, as you will also have to deal with increased maintenance costs, unrest, and threats from your rivals.

## Research and Develop
 
Research is one of the most important aspects of Armada 2526 Gold Edition. There are more than 150 technology items to research in six different categories: weapons, shields, engines, sensors, construction, and society. Each category has its own research tree with multiple branches and options. You should research technologies that match your race's strengths and your strategy's needs. For example, if you want to have a strong military presence, you should research weapons and shields that give you an edge in combat. If you want to have a fast and agile fleet, you should research engines and sensors that improve your speed and range. If you want to have a prosperous and stable empire, you should research construction and society that enhance your infrastructure and happiness.

However, diplomacy can also be tricky and unpredictable. You never know when an ally might betray you or an enemy might surprise you with a peace offer.
