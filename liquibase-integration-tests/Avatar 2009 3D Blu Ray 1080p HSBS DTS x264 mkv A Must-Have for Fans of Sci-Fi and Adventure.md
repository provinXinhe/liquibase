Avatar is a 2009 science fiction epic film directed by James Cameron, starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang. The film is set in the 22nd century, when humans are mining a precious mineral called unobtanium on the lush moon of Pandora, inhabited by the Na'vi, a blue-skinned humanoid race with their own language and culture. The film follows Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program, a project that allows him to remotely control a genetically engineered Na'vi body in order to interact with the natives and persuade them to relocate.
 
The film was released in both 2D and 3D formats, and was praised for its groundbreaking visual effects, immersive 3D experience, and environmental message. The film also received critical acclaim for its storytelling, performances, music, and themes. Avatar became the highest-grossing film of all time until it was surpassed by Avengers: Endgame in 2019. It also won three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, and Best Art Direction.

He also faces a moral dilemma when he has to choose between his loyalty to his human comrades and his allegiance to his new family.
 
The film also features a memorable cast of characters, both human and alien. Sam Worthington delivers a convincing performance as Jake Sully, who undergoes a remarkable transformation throughout the film.
