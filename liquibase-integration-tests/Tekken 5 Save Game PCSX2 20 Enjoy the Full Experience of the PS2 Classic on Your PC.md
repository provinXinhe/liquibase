## Step 1: Create a Virtual Memory Card
 
The first thing you need to do is create a virtual memory card for Tekken 5. This is where your game data will be stored and accessed by the emulator. To create a virtual memory card, follow these steps:
 
- Open PCSX2 20 and go to Config > Memory Cards.
- Click on the Slot 1 button and select Create.
- Choose a name and a size for your virtual memory card. The default name is Mcd001.ps2 and the default size is 8 MB, which is enough for most games. You can change these if you want, but make sure that the name ends with .ps2 and the size is a multiple of 8 MB.
- Click OK and then Apply.
- You should see your virtual memory card listed under Slot 1. You can also create another virtual memory card for Slot 2 if you want to use two different save files or play with another player.

## Step 2: Format Your Virtual Memory Card
 
The next thing you need to do is format your virtual memory card so that it can be used by Tekken 5. This will erase any existing data on the virtual memory card, so make sure that you don't have any important save files on it. To format your virtual memory card, follow these steps:

- Insert your Tekken 5 disc or ISO file into your PC's drive or mount it using a software like Daemon Tools.
- Run PCSX2 20 and go to CDVD > ISO Selector > Browse and select your Tekken 5 disc or ISO file.
- Go to System > Boot CDVD (full).
- You should see the PS2 logo and then the PS2 browser screen.
- Select your virtual memory card slot and press X.
- You should see a message asking you if you want to format the memory card. Select Yes and press X.
- Wait for the formatting process to finish. You should see a message saying that the memory card has been formatted successfully.
- Press Circle to go back to the PS2 browser screen.

## Step 3: Save Your Game Progress in Tekken 5
