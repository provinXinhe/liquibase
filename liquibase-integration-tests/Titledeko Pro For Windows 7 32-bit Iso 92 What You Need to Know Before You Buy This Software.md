Nesfield's Manual of English Grammar and Composition is not only a useful resource for learning and teaching English, but also a valuable piece of linguistic history. It reflects the views and standards of English usage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the British Empire was at its peak and English was spreading across the world. It also shows how the language has changed over time, as some of the rules and examples given by Nesfield are no longer valid or common today.
 
For instance, Nesfield states that "the verb ought always takes an infinitive without to" (p. 32), which is not true in modern English, where we can say "you ought to study hard" or "you ought not to waste your time". He also uses words and expressions that are now obsolete or archaic, such as "thou", "thy", "thee", "whomsoever", "whencesoever", "methinks", "peradventure", etc. He also gives some outdated advice on spelling, such as "write practise with s when it is a verb" (p. 6), which is now considered British English only.
 
However, despite these limitations, Nesfield's Manual of English Grammar and Composition still offers a lot of useful and interesting information on the structure, style, and history of the English language. It covers topics such as parts of speech, syntax, punctuation, sentence formation, word choice, figures of speech, prose and poetry analysis, and the origin and development of English. It also provides numerous examples, exercises, and tests to help learners practice and improve their skills.
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a free download of Nesfield's Manual of English Grammar and Composition, you should not miss this opportunity to get a copy of this classic book. It will not only help you learn more about English grammar and composition, but also enrich your knowledge of the language and its history.
