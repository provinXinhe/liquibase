In this article, we will show you some examples of photovoltaic systems that you can design with Solarius PV 9. You will see how easy and fast it is to create 3D models of different types of installations, such as rooftop, ground-mounted or integrated systems. You will also learn how to calculate the solar irradiation data, the effects of shading and the optimal orientation and inclination of the PV modules. Finally, you will see how to generate the wiring diagrams and the financial analysis of your photovoltaic projects.
 
Let's start with a simple example of a rooftop photovoltaic system on a residential building. To create the 3D model of the building, you can use the parametric objects provided by Solarius PV 9, such as walls, roofs, windows and doors. You can also import a DXF or DWG CAD drawing or a BIM model from other software and use it as a reference. Solarius PV 9 will automatically recognize the surfaces suitable for installing PV modules and will allow you to define the layout and configuration of the system.
 
Once you have created the 3D model of the building and the PV system, you can proceed to calculate the solar irradiation data for your location. Solarius PV 9 will connect to Meteonormâ¢ or PVGISâ¢ climatic databases and will provide you with monthly and annual values of global horizontal irradiation (GHI), direct normal irradiation (DNI) and diffuse horizontal irradiation (DHI). You can also create your own archive of solar radiation data from other sources or measurements.
 
The next step is to evaluate the effects of shading on your photovoltaic system. Solarius PV 9 allows you to do this in two ways: by using a photo or by using the solar diagram. If you have a photo of the installation site taken from a specific point of view, you can upload it to Solarius PV 9 and use it to identify the obstacles that may cause shading on your PV modules. Solarius PV 9 will then calculate the shading factor for each module and show you the results in a graphical and numerical way.
 
If you don't have a photo, you can use the solar diagram tool to simulate the sun path over your location throughout the year. Solarius PV 9 will show you the position and altitude of the sun for each hour of the day and each month of the year. You can then draw the profile of the horizon and any obstacles that may affect your photovoltaic system. Solarius PV 9 will calculate the shading factor for each module and show you the results in a graphical and numerical way.
 
After calculating the shading factor, you can optimize the orientation and inclination of your PV modules to maximize their energy production. Solarius PV 9 will suggest you the best values for these parameters based on your location, solar irradiation data and shading factor. You can also manually adjust these values and see how they affect the performance of your photovoltaic system.
