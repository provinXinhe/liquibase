Creedence Clearwater Revival was one of the most successful and influential rock bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s. They had 14 consecutive top 10 singles in the U.S., including two number ones, and five consecutive top 10 albums, two of which reached number one as well. [^3^] They were also the only band that had more than two singles topping the American charts at the same time. [^4^]
 
The band's music was rooted in swamp rock, roots rock, blues rock, and country rock, with a distinctive sound that combined John Fogerty's raspy vocals, catchy melodies, and socially conscious lyrics. They drew inspiration from Southern rock and roll and blues legends such as Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Bo Diddley, and Muddy Waters. They also covered songs by artists such as Marvin Gaye, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Lead Belly, and Dale Hawkins. [^3^]
 
Creedence Clearwater Revival performed at the legendary Woodstock festival in 1969, where they played for an hour and a half in front of a massive crowd. They were the first major act signed to appear there. [^2^] They also played at other famous venues and events, such as the Fillmore West, the Royal Albert Hall, and the Atlantic City Pop Festival. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. [^1^]
 
Unfortunately, the band broke up in 1972 due to internal conflicts and legal disputes. John Fogerty pursued a solo career, while Tom Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford formed other bands or joined other projects. Tom Fogerty died in 1990 from complications of AIDS. John Fogerty refused to perform with Cook and Clifford at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Cook and Clifford later formed Creedence Clearwater Revisited, a tribute band that plays CCR songs live. [^3^]
 
Despite their short-lived career, Creedence Clearwater Revival left a lasting legacy on rock music and culture. Their songs have been covered by countless artists from various genres, such as Ike and Tina Turner, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, The Ramones, U2, Foo Fighters, and Kid Rock. Their music has also been featured in many movies, TV shows, video games, and commercials. They have sold over 30 million records worldwide and have been awarded 10Ã platinum for their compilation album Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits. [^3^]
