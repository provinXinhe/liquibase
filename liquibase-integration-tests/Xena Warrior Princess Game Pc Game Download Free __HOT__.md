The Xena Warrior Princess game was released in 1999 by Brilliant Digital Entertainment, Inc. as a "Multipath Movie", which means that you can choose different actions and dialogue options that affect the outcome of the story. The game features real-time 3D graphics, voice acting by the original cast members, and multiple endings to discover.
