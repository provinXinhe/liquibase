# How to Download Norman Biggs' Discrete Mathematics for Free
 
Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with finite and discrete structures, such as logic, sets, graphs, algorithms, cryptography, and coding theory. It is often used in computer science, engineering, and cryptography.
 
One of the most popular textbooks on discrete mathematics is *Discrete Mathematics* by Norman Biggs, a professor of mathematics at the London School of Economics. This book covers topics such as logic, proof techniques, number theory, combinatorics, graph theory, algebraic structures, and cryptography. It also includes many exercises and examples to help students learn and practice the concepts.

In this article, we will review some of the main topics covered in Norman Biggs' *Discrete Mathematics* and give some examples of how they are applied in real-world problems.
 
## Logic and Proof
 
Logic is the study of the principles and methods of reasoning. It involves the use of symbols and rules to represent and manipulate statements, arguments, and proofs. Logic is essential for discrete mathematics, as it provides the tools and techniques for constructing rigorous and valid proofs.
 
A proof is a logical argument that establishes the truth of a statement based on some given assumptions or axioms. There are different types of proofs, such as direct, indirect, contradiction, induction, and contradiction. A proof can be written in natural language or in a formal language using symbols and notation.
 
For example, here is a proof of the statement "If n is an odd integer, then n^2 is odd" using a direct proof:

> Let n be an odd integer. Then by definition, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1. Since 2k^2 + 2k is an integer, we can write n^2 = 2m + 1 for some integer m. Therefore, n^2 is odd by definition.

## Number Theory
 
Number theory is the study of the properties and relationships of integers and other types of numbers. It involves topics such as divisibility, prime numbers, modular arithmetic, congruences, cryptography, and Diophantine equations.
 
A prime number is a positive integer that has exactly two positive divisors: itself and one. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are prime numbers. A composite number is a positive integer that has more than two positive divisors. For example, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are composite numbers.
 
Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic where numbers are reduced to a fixed range by using a modulus. For example, if we use modulus 12, then we can write 15 â¡ 3 (mod 12), which means that 15 and 3 have the same remainder when divided by 12. Modular arithmetic is useful for simplifying calculations and for solving problems involving periodicity and symmetry.
 
Cryptography is the science of secure communication using codes and ciphers. It involves techniques such as encryption, decryption, key generation, and authentication. Cryptography relies on number theory for creating and breaking codes and ciphers based on mathematical problems that are easy to solve in one direction but hard to solve in the other direction.
 
For example, one of the most widely used public-key encryption schemes is RSA (named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman). It works as follows:

- Choose two large prime numbers p and q.
- Compute n = pq and Ï(n) = (p-1)(q-1), where Ï(n) is Euler's totient function that counts the number of positive integers less than n that are relatively prime to n.
- Choose an integer e such that 1 < e < Ï(n) and gcd(e, Ï(n)) = 1 (e and Ï(n) are relatively prime).
- Compute d such that de â¡ 1 (mod Ï(n)) (d is the multiplicative inverse of e modulo Ï(n)).
- The public key is (n,e) and the private key is (n,d).
- To encrypt a message m (represented as an integer), compute c = m^e (mod n).
- To decrypt a ciphertext c, compute m = c^d (mod n).

The security of RSA depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Given n = pq, it is easy to compute Ï(n) if we know p and q. But given only n and e (the public key), it is very hard to find p and q (and hence d) without using brute force or sophisticated algorithms.
