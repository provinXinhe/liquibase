In this article, we will show you how to do that using a software called Nucleus Coop, which allows you to run multiple instances of the game on the same PC and use controllers or keyboards to control them. You will also need some additional files to enable zombie and multiplayer modes on the cracked version. This method works for both LAN and splitscreen gaming.
 
## Step 1: Download a Cracked Version of the Game
 
The first step is to download a cracked version of Call of Duty Black Ops 2 from a reliable source. We recommend using IGG Games, which has a working crack that includes 36 DLCs. You can find the link [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/78dgdn/call_of_duty_black_ops_2_36_dlcs_mp_with_bots/). The download size is about 18.8 GB.
 
## Step 2: Download Zombie and Multiplayer Files
 
The next step is to download the files that enable zombie and multiplayer modes on the cracked version. These files are not included in the IGG Games crack, so you will need to get them separately. You can find the links [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/vt47nn/call_of_duty_black_ops_2_working_splitscreen/). The download sizes are 946 MB for zombie mode and 1.55 GB for multiplayer mode.

## Step 3: Extract and Copy the Files to the Game Folder
 
After downloading the files, you will need to extract them using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get two folders: zombie files.rar and multiplayer files.rar. You will need to copy the contents of these folders to the game folder where you installed the cracked version. You can overwrite any existing files if prompted.
 
## Step 4: Download and Install Nucleus Coop
 
Nucleus Coop is a software that allows you to play local co-op games on PC using multiple instances of the game and different input devices. You can download it from [here](https://github.com/ZeroFox5866/nucleuscoop/releases). The download size is about 100 MB. After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions.
 
## Step 5: Download and Add the Game Handlers
 
A game handler is a script that tells Nucleus Coop how to run a specific game. You will need two game handlers for Call of Duty Black Ops 2: one for zombie mode (t6zm) and one for multiplayer mode (t6mp). You can download them from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/vt47nn/call_of_duty_black_ops_2_working_splitscreen/). The download sizes are 3 KB each.
 
After downloading, you will need to add them to Nucleus Coop. To do that, open Nucleus Coop and click on "Search Game". Then, click on "Add Game" and browse to the folder where you downloaded the game handlers. Select one of them and click "Open". Repeat this for the other game handler.
 
## Step 6: Configure and Launch the Game Instances
 
The final step is to configure and launch the game instances using Nucleus Coop. To do that, open Nucleus Coop and select either t6zm or t6mp from the list of games. Then, click on "Configure" and choose how many instances you want to run (up to four), which input device each instance will use (controller or keyboard), and how you want to split the screen (horizontal or vertical).
