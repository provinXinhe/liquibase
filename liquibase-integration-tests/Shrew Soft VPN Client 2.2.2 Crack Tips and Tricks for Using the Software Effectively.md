In this article, we will show you how to install and use Shrew Soft VPN Client 2.2.2 on Windows 10. You can follow these steps:

1. Download the VPN Client Installer from the Shrew Soft website. Choose the edition that suits your needs: Standard or Professional. The Professional edition offers more features, such as split tunneling, policy generation and NAT traversal, but it requires a license key after a 14-day trial period.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions. You will be prompted to select the components to install, the installation directory and the edition to install. You will also need to accept the legal notices and the license agreement.
3. After the installation is complete, launch the VPN Access Manager from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a list of VPN sites that you can connect to. You can also create your own VPN site by clicking on the Add button.
4. To create a VPN site, you will need to enter the following information: a name for the site, the host name or IP address of your VPN server, the VPN protocol and port, the authentication method and credentials, and the encryption algorithm and key. You can also configure other settings, such as DNS servers, routes, policies and options.
5. After you have created your VPN site, you can connect to it by selecting it from the list and clicking on the Connect button. You will see a status window that shows you the progress of your VPN connection. If everything goes well, you will see a green check mark and a message that says "tunnel enabled".
6. You can now browse the internet securely and privately through your VPN connection. You can also check your IP address and location by visiting a website like https://www.whatismyip.com/. You should see your VPN server's IP address and location instead of your real ones.
7. To disconnect from your VPN site, select it from the list and click on the Disconnect button. You will see a status window that shows you the progress of your VPN disconnection. If everything goes well, you will see a red cross and a message that says "tunnel disabled".
